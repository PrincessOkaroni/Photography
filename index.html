        <p>
          Hi, I'm Purity, a passionate photographer with a love for capturing
          the beauty of everyday moments. With years of experience in portrait,
          landscape, and event photography, I strive to create images that tell
          a story and evoke emotion. My journey into photography started as a
          hobby and quickly turned into a lifelong passion. Through my lens, I
          aim to highlight the essence of each subject, bringing their unique
          stories to life.
